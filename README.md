# PROJECT 2 - Opera House - Server

## Intro
This is the backend server for an Opera House website. This serves mostly as an API from which the front end can send and pull data. The database uses 6 models to create a user booking system for events at the Opera House, where a user can book a seat for an event in an event space. The front end can use axios post and get requests to the backend to update the database.

## LIVE SITE
[Click here](https://operahouse-server.herokuapp.com/) for the live site. However the site functions as purely a server and is not necessarily for user interaction.
